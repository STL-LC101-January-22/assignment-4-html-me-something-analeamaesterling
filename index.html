               Like many people I have a bad habit of picking up a lot of hobbies and mastering none of them.
               Hopefully I can master web development. This dinky little page is in pursuit of that. Wish me luck! In the meantime,
               heres some other things I have tried out over the years.

               Mostly me getting beat up because I'm not good at this sport. Fought like a beast for years only to be tossed around 
               like a ragdoll. Still fun.

               I like this sport better because the walls don't fight you. Climbing &gt; JiuJitsu. Its a good sport that is difficult, 
               but easy to take at your own pace. You can climb things that are very easy or take on difficult things at your liesure.

               I started climbing because it was safer than jiu jitsu during the worst of the covid pandemic. To me its another interesting
               impact of the pandemic. People flocked to climbing as a sport. Turns out its not that hygenic because a lot of the more
               experienced climbers bite the ropes for convenience. Yum!

               In college I worked in a laboratory that studied birds and Avian Malaria. We went to a few places to sample
               bird blood and get an idea of what they carried. The birds will fight you. If they think they can reach your
               eyes and peck them out they will try. I learned a lot about population genetics and miss that time of my life.
